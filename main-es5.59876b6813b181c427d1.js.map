It\n   * might be for example a function that you passed to Observable's constructor, but most of the time it is\n   * a library implementation, which defines what will be emitted by an Observable, and when it be will emitted. This means\n   * that calling `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n   * the thought.\n   *\n   * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n   * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n   * of the following ways.\n   *\n   * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n   * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n   * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n   * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n   * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n   * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, if the `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n   * be left uncaught.\n   *\n   * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n   * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where the first function is equivalent\n   * of a `next` method, the second of an `error` method and the third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n   * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n   * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n   * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n   *\n   * Whichever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n   * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop the work that an Observable does and will clean\n   * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n   * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n   *\n   * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n   * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}\n   * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable\n   * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a `scheduler`.\n   *\n   * ## Example\n   * ### Subscribe with an Observer\n   * ```ts\n   * import { of } from 'rxjs';\n   *\n   * const sumObserver = {\n   *   sum: 0,\n   *   next(value) {\n   *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n   *     this.sum = this.sum + value;\n   *   },\n   *   error() {\n   *     // We actually could just remove this method,\n   *     // since we do not really care about errors right now.\n   *   },\n   *   complete() {\n   *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);\n   *   }\n   * };\n   *\n   * of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.\n   *   .subscribe(sumObserver);\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // \"Adding: 1\"\n   * // \"Adding: 2\"\n   * // \"Adding: 3\"\n   * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Subscribe with functions\n   * ```ts\n   * import { of } from 'rxjs'\n   *\n   * let sum = 0;\n   *\n   * of(1, 2, 3).subscribe(\n   *   value => {\n   *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n   *     sum = sum + value;\n   *   },\n   *   undefined,\n   *   () => console.log('Sum equals: ' + sum)\n   * );\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // \"Adding: 1\"\n   * // \"Adding: 2\"\n   * // \"Adding: 3\"\n   * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Cancel a subscription\n   * ```ts\n   * import { interval } from 'rxjs';\n   *\n   * const subscription = interval(1000).subscribe(\n   *   num => console.log(num),\n   *   undefined,\n   *   () => {\n   *     // Will not be called, even when cancelling subscription.\n   *     console.log('completed!');\n   *   }\n   * );\n   *\n   * setTimeout(() => {\n   *   subscription.unsubscribe();\n   *   console.log('unsubscribed!');\n   * }, 2500);\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // 0 after 1s\n   * // 1 after 2s\n   * // \"unsubscribed!\" after 2.5s\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @param {Observer|Function} observerOrNext (optional) Either an observer with methods to be called,\n   *  or the first of three possible handlers, which is the handler for each value emitted from the subscribed\n   *  Observable.\n   * @param {Function} error (optional) A handler for a terminal event resulting from an error.

Unlike ngDoCheck, ngOnChanges and ngOnInit, which are\n// called during a pre-order traversal of the view tree (that is calling the\n// parent hooks before the child hooks) these events are sent in using a\n// post-order traversal of the tree (children before parents). This changes the\n// meaning of initIndex in the view state. For ngOnInit, initIndex tracks the\n// expected nodeIndex which a ngOnInit should be called. When sending\n// ngAfterContentInit and ngAfterViewInit it is the expected count of\n// ngAfterContentInit or ngAfterViewInit methods that have been called. This\n// ensure that despite being called recursively or after picking up after an\n// exception, the ngAfterContentInit or ngAfterViewInit will be called on the\n// correct nodes. Consider for example, the following (where E is an element\n// and D is a directive)\n//  Tree:       pre-order index  post-order index\n//    E1        0                6\n//      E2      1                1\n//       D3     2                0\n//      E4      3                5\n//       E5     4                4\n//        E6    5                2\n//        E7    6                3\n// As can be seen, the post-order index has an unclear relationship to the\n// pre-order index (postOrderIndex === preOrderIndex - parentCount +\n// childCount). Since number of calls to ngAfterContentInit and ngAfterViewInit\n// are stable (will be the same for the same view regardless of exceptions or\n// recursion) we just need to count them which will roughly correspond to the\n// post-order index (it skips elements and directives that do not have\n// lifecycle hooks).\n//\n// For example, if an exception is raised in the E6.onAfterViewInit() the\n// initIndex is left at 3 (by shouldCallLifecycleInitHook() which set it to\n// initIndex + 1). When checkAndUpdateView() is called again D3, E2 and E6 will\n// not have their ngAfterViewInit() called but, starting with E7, the rest of\n// the view will begin getting ngAfterViewInit() called until a check and\n// pass is complete.\n//\n// This algorthim also handles recursion. Consider if E4's ngAfterViewInit()\n// indirectly calls E1's ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges(). The expected\n// initIndex is set to 6, the recusive checkAndUpdateView() starts walk again.\n// D3, E2, E6, E7, E5 and E4 are skipped, ngAfterViewInit() is called on E1.\n// When the recursion returns the initIndex will be 7 so E1 is skipped as it\n// has already been called in the recursively called checkAnUpdateView().\nexport function callLifecycleHooksChildrenFirst(view: ViewData, lifecycles: NodeFlags) {\n  if (!(view.def.nodeFlags & lifecycles)) {\n    return;\n  }\n  const nodes = view.def.nodes;\n  let initIndex = 0;\n  for (let i = 0; i < nodes.length; i++) {\n    const nodeDef = nodes[i];\n    let parent = nodeDef.parent;\n    if (!parent && nodeDef.flags & lifecycles) {\n      // matching root node (e.g. a pipe)\n      callProviderLifecycles(view, i, nodeDef.flags & lifecycles, initIndex++);\n    }\n    if ((nodeDef.childFlags & lifecycles) === 0) {\n      // no child matches one of the lifecycles\n      i += nodeDef.childCount;\n    }\n    while (parent && (parent.flags & NodeFlags.TypeElement) &&\n           i === parent.nodeIndex + parent.childCount) {\n      // last child of an element\n      if (parent.directChildFlags & lifecycles) {\n        initIndex = callElementProvidersLifecycles(view, parent, lifecycles, initIndex);\n      }\n      parent = parent.parent;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nfunction callElementProvidersLifecycles(\n    view: ViewData, elDef: NodeDef, lifecycles: NodeFlags, initIndex: number): number {\n  for (let i = elDef.nodeIndex + 1; i <= elDef.nodeIndex + elDef.childCount; i++) {\n    const nodeDef = view.def.nodes[i];\n    if (nodeDef.flags & lifecycles) {\n      callProviderLifecycles(view, i, nodeDef.flags & lifecycles, initIndex++);\n    }\n    // only visit direct children\n    i += nodeDef.childCount;\n  }\n  return initIndex;\n}\n\nfunction callProviderLifecycles(\n    view: ViewData, index: number, lifecycles: NodeFlags, initIndex: number) {\n  const providerData = asProviderData(view, index);\n  if (!providerData) {\n    return;\n  }\n  const provider = providerData.instance;\n  if (!provider) {\n    return;\n  }\n  Services.setCurrentNode(view, index);\n  if (lifecycles & NodeFlags.AfterContentInit &&\n      shouldCallLifecycleInitHook(view, ViewState.InitState_CallingAfterContentInit, initIndex)) {\n    provider.ngAfterContentInit();\n  }\n  if (lifecycles & NodeFlags.AfterContentChecked) {\n    provider.ngAfterContentChecked();\n  }\n  if (lifecycles & NodeFlags.AfterViewInit &&\n      shouldCallLifecycleInitHook(view, ViewState.InitState_CallingAfterViewInit, initIndex)) {\n    provider.ngAfterViewInit();\n  }\n  if (lifecycles & NodeFlags.AfterViewChecked) {\n    provider.ngAfterViewChecked();\n  }\n  if (lifecycles & NodeFlags.OnDestroy) {\n    provider.ngOnDestroy();\n  }\n}\n","/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

examples and caveats\n *\n * Note two important points about `isStable`, demonstrated in the examples below:\n * - the application will never be stable if you start any kind\n * of recurrent asynchronous task when the application starts\n * (for example for a polling process, started with a `setInterval`, a `setTimeout`\n * or using RxJS operators like `interval`);\n * - the `isStable` Observable runs outside of the Angular zone.\n *\n * Let's imagine that you start a recurrent task\n * (here incrementing a counter, using RxJS `interval`),\n * and at the same time subscribe to `isStable`.\n *\n * ```\n * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {\n *   appRef.isStable.pipe(\n *      filter(stable => stable)\n *   ).subscribe(() => console.log('App is stable now');\n *   interval(1000).subscribe(counter => console.log(counter));\n * }\n * ```\n * In this example, `isStable` will never emit `true`,\n * and the trace \"App is stable now\" will never get logged.\n *\n * If you want to execute something when the app is stable,\n * you have to wait for the application to be stable\n * before starting your polling process.\n *\n * ```\n * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {\n *   appRef.isStable.pipe(\n *     first(stable => stable),\n *     tap(stable => console.log('App is stable now')),\n *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))\n *   ).subscribe(counter => console.log(counter));\n * }\n * ```\n * In this example, the trace \"App is stable now\" will be logged\n * and then the counter starts incrementing every second.\n *\n * Note also that this Observable runs outside of the Angular zone,\n * which means that the code in the subscription\n * to this Observable will not trigger the change detection.\n *\n * Let's imagine that instead of logging the counter value,\n * you update a field of your component\n * and display it in its template.\n *\n * ```\n * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {\n *   appRef.isStable.pipe(\n *     first(stable => stable),\n *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))\n *   ).subscribe(counter => this.value = counter);\n * }\n * ```\n * As the `isStable` Observable runs outside the zone,\n * the `value` field will be updated properly,\n * but the template will not be refreshed!\n *\n * You'll have to manually trigger the change detection to update the template.\n *\n * ```\n * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef, cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {\n *   appRef.isStable.pipe(\n *     first(stable => stable),\n *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))\n *   ).subscribe(counter => {\n *     this.value = counter;\n *     cd.detectChanges();\n *   });\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Or make the subscription callback run inside the zone.\n *\n * ```\n * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef, zone: NgZone) {\n *   appRef.isStable.pipe(\n *     first(stable => stable),\n *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))\n *   ).subscribe(counter => zone.run(() => this.value = counter));\n * }\n * ```\n *\n *

It might be useful, if you do not have control over\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\n *\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\n * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n *\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`\n * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error\n * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator\n * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used\n * for notification emissions in general.\n *\n * ## Example\n * Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.\n * ```ts\n * import { interval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { observeOn } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const intervals = interval(10);                // Intervals are scheduled\n *                                                // with async scheduler by default...\n * intervals.pipe(\n *   observeOn(animationFrameScheduler),          // ...but we will observe on animationFrame\n * )                                              // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.\n * .subscribe(val => {\n *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link delay}\n *\n * @param {SchedulerLike} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.\n * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,\n * but with provided scheduler.\n *\n * @method observeOn\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function observeOn<T>(scheduler: SchedulerLike, delay: number = 0): MonoTypeOperatorFunction<T> {\n  return function observeOnOperatorFunction(source: Observable<T>): Observable<T> {\n    return source.lift(new ObserveOnOperator(scheduler, delay));\n  };\n}\n\nexport class ObserveOnOperator<T> implements Operator<T, T> {\n  constructor(private scheduler: SchedulerLike, private delay: number = 0) {\n  }\n\n  call(subscriber: Subscriber<T>, source: any): TeardownLogic {\n    return source.subscribe(new ObserveOnSubscriber(subscriber, this.scheduler, this.delay));\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nexport class ObserveOnSubscriber<T> extends Subscriber<T> {\n  /** @nocollapse */\n  static dispatch(this: SchedulerAction<ObserveOnMessage>, arg: ObserveOnMessage) {\n    const { notification, destination } = arg;\n    notification.observe(destination);\n    this.unsubscribe();\n  }\n\n  constructor(destination: Subscriber<T>,\n              private scheduler: SchedulerLike,\n              private delay: number = 0) {\n    super(destination);\n  }\n\n  private scheduleMessage(notification: Notification<any>): void {\n    const destination = this.destination as Subscription;\n    destination.add(this.scheduler.schedule(\n      ObserveOnSubscriber.dispatch,\n      this.delay,\n      new ObserveOnMessage(notification, this.destination)\n    ));\n  }\n\n  protected _next(value: T): void {\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createNext(value));\n  }\n\n  protected _error(err: any): void {\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createError(err));\n    this.unsubscribe();\n  }\n\n  protected _complete(): void {\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createComplete());\n    this.unsubscribe();\n  }\n}\n\nexport class ObserveOnMessage {\n  constructor(public notification: Notification<any>,\n              public destination: PartialObserver<any>) {\n  }\n}\n","import { Subject } from './Subject';\nimport { SchedulerLike } from './types';\nimport { queue } from './scheduler/queue';\nimport { Subscriber } from './Subscriber';\nimport { Subscription } from './Subscription';\nimport { ObserveOnSubscriber } from './operators/observeOn';\nimport { ObjectUnsubscribedError } from './util/ObjectUnsubscribedError';\nimport { SubjectSubscription } from './SubjectSubscription';\n/**\n * A variant of Subject that \"replays\" or emits old values to new subscribers.\n * It buffers a set number of values and will emit those values immediately to\n * any new subscribers in addition to emitting new values to existing subscribers.\n *\n * @class ReplaySubject<T>\n */\nexport class ReplaySubject<T> extends Subject<T> {\n  private _events: (ReplayEvent<T> | T)[] = [];\n  private _bufferSize: number;\n  private _windowTime: number;\n  private _infiniteTimeWindow: boolean = false;\n\n  constructor(bufferSize: number = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY,\n              windowTime: number = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY,\n              private scheduler?: SchedulerLike) {\n    super();\n    this._bufferSize = bufferSize < 1 ?

![](concat.png)\n *\n * `concat` joins multiple Observables together, by subscribing to them one at a time and\n * merging their results into the output Observable. You can pass either an array of\n * Observables, or put them directly as arguments. Passing an empty array will result\n * in Observable that completes immediately.\n *\n * `concat` will subscribe to first input Observable and emit all its values, without\n * changing or affecting them in any way. When that Observable completes, it will\n * subscribe to then next Observable passed and, again, emit its values. This will be\n * repeated, until the operator runs out of Observables. When last input Observable completes,\n * `concat` will complete as well. At any given moment only one Observable passed to operator\n * emits values. If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out\n * {@link merge} instead, especially with optional `concurrent` parameter. As a matter of fact,\n * `concat` is an equivalent of `merge` operator with `concurrent` parameter set to `1`.\n *\n * Note that if some input Observable never completes, `concat` will also never complete\n * and Observables following the one that did not complete will never be subscribed. On the other\n * hand, if some Observable simply completes immediately after it is subscribed, it will be\n * invisible for `concat`, which will just move on to the next Observable.\n *\n * If any Observable in chain errors, instead of passing control to the next Observable,\n * `concat` will error immediately as well. Observables that would be subscribed after\n * the one that emitted error, never will.\n *\n * If you pass to `concat` the same Observable many times, its stream of values\n * will be \"replayed\" on every subscription, which means you can repeat given Observable\n * as many times as you like. If passing the same Observable to `concat` 1000 times becomes tedious,\n * you can always use {@link repeat}.\n *\n * ## Examples\n * ### Concatenate a timer counting from 0 to 3 with a synchronous

enable us\n * running in zone-full as well as zone-less mode without any changes to the code.\n *\n * The current way of binding an observable to the view looks like that:\n *  ```html\n *  {{observable$ | async}}\n * <ng-container *ngIf=\"observable$ | async as o\">{{o}}</ng-container>\n * <component [value]=\"observable$ | async\"></component>\n * ```\n *\n * The problem is `async` pipe just marks the component and all its ancestors as dirty.\n * It needs zone.js microtask queue to exhaust until `ApplicationRef.tick` is called to render all dirty marked components.\n *\n * Heavy dynamic and interactive UIs suffer from zones change detection a lot and can\n * lean to bad performance or even unusable applications, but the `async` pipe does not work in zone-less mode.\n *\n * `ngrxPush` pipe solves that problem.\n *\n * Included Features:\n *  - Take observables or promises, retrieve their values and render the value to the template\n *  - Handling null and undefined values in a clean unified/structured way\n *  - Triggers change-detection differently if `zone.js` is present or not (`detectChanges` or `markForCheck`)\n *  - Distinct same values in a row to increase performance\n *  - Coalescing of change detection calls to boost performance\n *\n * @usageNotes\n *\n * `ngrxPush` pipe solves that problem. It can be used like shown here:\n * ```html\n * {{observable$ | ngrxPush}}\n * <ng-container *ngIf=\"observable$ | ngrxPush as o\">{{o}}</ng-container>\n * <component [value]=\"observable$ | ngrxPush\"></component>\n * ```\n *\n * @publicApi\n */\n@Pipe({ name: 'ngrxPush', pure: false })\nexport class PushPipe<S> implements PipeTransform, OnDestroy {\n  private renderedValue: S | null | undefined;\n\n  private readonly configSubject = new Subject<PushPipeConfig>();\n  private readonly config$ = this.configSubject\n    .asObservable()\n    .pipe(distinctUntilChanged());\n\n  private readonly subscription: Unsubscribable;\n  private readonly cdAware: CdAware<S | null | undefined>;\n  private readonly updateViewContextObserver: PartialObserver<\n    S | null | undefined\n  > = {\n    next: (value: S | null | undefined) => (this.renderedValue = value),\n  };\n  private readonly resetContextObserver: NextObserver<unknown> = {\n    next: (value: unknown) => (this.renderedValue = undefined),\n  };\n  private readonly configurableBehaviour = <T>(\n    o$: Observable<Observable<T>>\n  ): Observable<Observable<T>> =>\n    o$.pipe(\n      withLatestFrom(this.config$),\n      map(([value$, config]) => {\n        return value$.pipe();\n      })\n    );\n\n  constructor(cdRef: ChangeDetectorRef, ngZone: NgZone) {\n    this.cdAware = createCdAware<S>({\n      work: setUpWork({\n        ngZone,\n        cdRef,\n        context: (cdRef as EmbeddedViewRef<Type<any>>).context,\n      }),\n      updateViewContextObserver: this.updateViewContextObserver,\n      resetContextObserver: this.resetContextObserver,\n      configurableBehaviour: this.configurableBehaviour,\n    });\n    this.subscription = this.cdAware.subscribe();\n  }\n\n  transform(potentialObservable: null, config?: PushPipeConfig): null;\n  transform(potentialObservable: undefined, config?: PushPipeConfig): undefined;\n  transform(\n    potentialObservable: Observable<S> | Promise<S>,\n    config?: PushPipeConfig\n  ): S;\n  transform(\n    potentialObservable: Observable<S> | Promise<S> | null | undefined,\n    config: PushPipeConfig = { optimized: true }\n  ): S | null | undefined {\n    this.configSubject.next(config);\n    this.cdAware.next(potentialObservable);\n    return this.renderedValue;\n  }\n\n  ngOnDestroy(): void {\n    this.subscription.unsubscribe();\n  }\n}\n","/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

Observable emits a value, it\n * computes a formula using the latest values from all the inputs, then emits\n * the output of that formula.</span>\n *\n * ![](combineLatest.png)\n *\n * `combineLatest` combines the values from all the Observables passed as\n * arguments. This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all these values but the last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, if some Observable does not emit a value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n *\n * ## Examples\n * ### Combine two timer Observables\n * ```ts\n * import { combineLatest, timer } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * const firstTimer = timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\n * const secondTimer = timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\n * const combinedTimers = combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\n * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\n * // [1, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\n * // [2, 1] after 2s\n * ```\n *\n * ### Combine an array of Observables\n * ```ts\n * import { combineLatest, of } from 'rxjs';\n * import { delay, starWith } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\n *   n => of(n).pipe(\n *     delay(n * 1000),   // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\n *     startWith(0),\n *   )\n * );\n * const combined = combineLatest(observables);\n * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\n * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\n * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index\n * ```ts\n * import { combineLatest, of } from 'rxjs';\n * import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const weight = of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);\n * const height = of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);\n * const bmi = combineLatest(weight, height).pipe(\n *   map(([w, h]) => w / (h * h)),\n * );\n * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));\n *\n * // With output to console:\n * // BMI is 24.212293388429753\n * // BMI is 23.93948099205209\n * // BMI is 23.671253629592222\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link merge}\n * @see {@link withLatestFrom}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable1 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable2 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as arguments\n * or an array of Observables may be given as the first argument.\n * @param {function} [project] An optional function to project the values from\n * the combined latest values into a new value on the output Observable.\n * @param {SchedulerLike} [scheduler=null] The {@link SchedulerLike} to use for subscribing to\n * each input Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n * each input Observable.\n */\nexport function combineLatest<O extends ObservableInput<any>, R>(\n  ...observables: (O | ((...values: ObservedValueOf<O>[]) => R) | SchedulerLike)[]\n): Observable<R> {\n  let resultSelector: (...values: Array<any>) => R =  null;\n  let scheduler: SchedulerLike = null;\n\n  if (isScheduler(observables[observables.length - 1])) {\n    scheduler = observables.pop() as SchedulerLike;\n  }\n\n  if (typeof observables[observables.length - 1] === 'function') {\n    resultSelector = observables.pop() as (...values: Array<any>) => R;\n  }\n\n  // if the first and only other argument besides the resultSelector is an array\n  // assume it's been called with `combineLatest([obs1, obs2, obs3], resultSelector)`\n  if (observables.length === 1 && isArray(observables[0])) {\n    observables = observables[0] as any;\n  }\n\n  return fromArray(observables, scheduler).lift(new CombineLatestOperator<ObservedValueOf<O>, R>(resultSelector));\n}\n\nexport class CombineLatestOperator<T, R> implements Operator<T, R> {\n  constructor(private resultSelector?: (...values: Array<any>) => R) {\n  }\n\n  call(subscriber: Subscriber<R>, source: any): any {\n    return source.subscribe(new CombineLatestSubscriber(subscriber, this.resultSelector));\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nexport class CombineLatestSubscriber<T, R> extends OuterSubscriber<T, R> {\n  private active: number = 0;\n  private values: any[] = [];\n  private observables: any[] = [];\n  private toRespond: number;\n\n  constructor(destination: Subscriber<R>, private resultSelector?: (...values: Array<any>) => R) {\n    super(destination);\n  }\n\n  protected _next(observable: any) {\n    this.values.push(NONE);\n    this.observables.push(observable);\n  }\n\n  protected _complete() {\n    const observables = this.observables;\n    const len = observables.length;\n    if (len === 0) {\n      this.destination.complete();\n    } else {\n      this.active = len;\n      this.toRespond = len;\n      for (let i = 0;

The 'Chat' component is placed into the 'aux' outlet.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team\n * }, {\n *   path: 'chat/:user',\n *   component: Chat\n *   outlet: 'aux'\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * ### Wild Cards\n *\n * The following route uses wild-card notation to specify a component\n * that is always instantiated regardless of where you navigate to.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '**',\n *   component: WildcardComponent\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * ### Redirects\n *\n * The following route uses the `redirectTo` property to ignore a segment of\n * a given URL when looking for a child path.\n *\n * When navigating to '/team/11/legacy/user/jim', the router changes the URL segment\n * '/team/11/legacy/user/jim' to '/team/11/user/jim', and then instantiates\n * the Team component with the User child component in it.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: 'legacy/user/:name',\n *     redirectTo: 'user/:name'\n *   }, {\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * The redirect path can be relative, as shown in this example, or absolute.\n * If we change the `redirectTo` value in the example to the absolute URL segment '/user/:name',\n * the result URL is also absolute, '/user/jim'.\n\n * ### Empty Path\n *\n * Empty-path route configurations can be used to instantiate components that do not 'consume'\n * any URL segments.\n *\n * In the following configuration, when navigating to\n * `/team/11`, the router instantiates the 'AllUsers' component.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: '',\n *     component: AllUsers\n *   }, {\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * Empty-path routes can have children. In the following example, when navigating\n * to `/team/11/user/jim`, the router instantiates the wrapper component with\n * the user component in it.\n *\n * Note that an empty path route inherits its parent's parameters and data.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: '',\n *     component: WrapperCmp,\n *     children: [{\n *       path: 'user/:name',\n *       component: User\n *     }]\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * ### Matching Strategy\n *\n * The default path-match strategy is 'prefix', which means that the router\n * checks URL elements from the left to see if the URL matches a specified path.\n * For example, '/team/11/user' matches 'team/:id'.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '',\n *   pathMatch: 'prefix', //default\n *   redirectTo: 'main'\n * }, {\n *   path: 'main',\n *   component: Main\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * You can specify the path-match strategy 'full' to make sure that the path\n * covers the whole unconsumed URL. It is important to do this when redirecting\n * empty-path routes. Otherwise, because an empty path is a prefix of any URL,\n * the router would apply the redirect even when navigating to the redirect destination,\n * creating an endless loop.\n *\n * In the following example, supplying the 'full' `pathMatch` strategy ensures\n * that the router applies the redirect if and only if navigating to '/'.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '',\n *   pathMatch: 'full',\n *   redirectTo: 'main'\n * }, {\n *   path: 'main',\n *   component: Main\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * ### Componentless Routes\n *\n * You can share parameters between sibling components.\n * For example, suppose that two sibling components should go next to each other,\n * and both of them require an ID parameter. You can accomplish this using a route\n * that does not specify a component at the top level.\n *\n * In the following example, 'MainChild' and 'AuxChild' are siblings.\n * When navigating to 'parent/10/(a//aux:b)', the route instantiates\n * the main child and aux child components next to each other.\n * For this to work, the application component must have the primary and aux outlets defined.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *    path: 'parent/:id',\n *    children: [\n *      { path: 'a', component: MainChild },\n *      { path: 'b', component: AuxChild, outlet: 'aux' }\n *    ]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * The router merges the parameters, data, and resolve of the componentless\n * parent into the parameters, data, and resolve of the children.\n *\n * This is especially useful when child components are defined\n * with an empty path string, as in the following example.\n * With this configuration, navigating to '/parent/10' creates\n * the main child and aux components.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *    path: 'parent/:id',\n *    children: [\n *      { path: '', component: MainChild },\n *      { path: '', component: AuxChild, outlet: 'aux' }\n *    ]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * ### Lazy Loading\n *\n * Lazy loading speeds up application load time by splitting the application\n * into multiple bundles and loading them on demand.\n * To use lazy loading, provide the `loadChildren` property  instead of the `children` property.\n *\n * Given the following example route, the router will lazy load\n * the associated module on demand using the browser native import system.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'lazy',\n *   loadChildren: () => import('./lazy-route/lazy.module').then(mod => mod.LazyModule),\n * }];\n * ```\n *\n * @publicApi\n */\nexport interface Route {\n  /**\n   * The path to match against.
